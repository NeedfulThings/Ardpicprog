# ArdPicProc

ArdPicProc is an Arduino-based solution for programming PIC microcontrollers. This repository contains a variant of [ArdPicProc by Rhys Weatherley](https://github.com/rweather/ardpicprog) adding compatibility with current avr-glibc. It only contains ProgramPIC, a sketch to turn your arduino into a PIC programmer, see the original repository for the hardware and PC parts.
